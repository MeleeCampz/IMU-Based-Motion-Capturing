This is the source code for my master thesis: "Low Cost IMU Based Motion Capturing"
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhYaXOSRsg4m8WcSUFc4nKz210LByOJa/view?usp=sharing

Included:
- Source code of the firmware for the ESP8266s used for the custom build IMU units
- Source code of the Unreal Engine project that was used to animate a character in realtime using the IMUs

Please note: This is by no means a ready-to-use solution!
I custom build the hardware and there is no detailed schematics on how to excatly reproduce this.

By now the version of Unreal I used is pretty outdated and upgrading to a newer verison will involve some serious work.
It is also not structured in a way, that it can be easily reused in another project without some cleanup first.

At least for the time beeing I am no longer actively working on this project.
